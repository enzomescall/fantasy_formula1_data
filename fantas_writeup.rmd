```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The data is downloaded from the following two google sheets:

Price: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b5486fzknvQgXJxPuS7U88HwMYLrz-EfdfTO3-w5qx0/pub?output=csv`
Points: `docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r4Cqm5E8pyER3nXix_A05SD3-EMusJZtk3XZAeFexvg/pub?output=csv`

```{r cars}
price_csv = read.csv("2022 Prices - Prices.csv")
points_csv = read.csv("2022 Standings - HomePage.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
